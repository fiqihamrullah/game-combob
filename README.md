# game-combob

Just find the same Image(couple images) and answer the questions of what they are(selected images). 
Number of questions based on level passed and must be completed within specified time frame. 
If the time runs out , the game will be over.

This is my old project (helped high-school student develop their own idea). I only recently started using Git as my portfolio.
